      'Dura came to life from a shared yearning for the tastes that truly define our Zimbabwean identity. It all started with a simple desire: to find and savor the traditional foods that we grew up cherishing. It was during this journey, in the midst of the hassle and the heartache of longing for a taste of home, that we encountered something truly special. Along the way, we met fellow Zimbabwean food enthusiasts who were on the same journey of seeking authenticity, tradition, and connection through the foods we hold dear.',

This serendipitous connection gave birth to Dura, a platform dedicated to making the flavors of our culture accessible to all. As we forged ahead, we were fueled by a dual purpose: to ensure that the traditional foods we remember remain accessible, and to create a space where our fellow food lovers can come together to celebrate, savor, and share in the vibrant tapestry of Zimbabwean cuisine.',
